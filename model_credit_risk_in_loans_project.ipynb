    "### Model Credit Risk in Loans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data and their own data science process and assign an interest rate to the borrower. The interest rate is the percent in addition to the requested loan amount the borrower has to pay back.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A higher interest rate means that the borrower is riskier and more unlikely to pay back the loan while a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history is more likely to pay back the loan. The interest rates range from 5.32% all the way to 30.99% and each borrower is given a grade according to the interest rate they were assigned. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investors are primarily interested in receiveing a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose for the loan, and other information from the application. Once they're ready to back a loan, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan's requested amount is fully funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The borrower then makes monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off to start to see money back. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time, however, and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically on their website. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before diving into the datasets themselves, let's get familiar with the data dictionary. The LoanStats sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the RejectStats describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data on approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The approved loans datasets contain information on current loans, completed loans, and defaulted loans. Let's now define the problem statement for this machine learning project:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before we can start doing machine learning, we need to define what features we want to use and which column repesents the target column we want to predict.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Fully Paid: Loan has been fully paid off.\n",
    "- Charged Off: Loan for which there is no longer a reasonable expectation of further payments.\n",
    "- Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Fully Paid: While the loan was paid off, the loan application today would no longer meet the credit policy and wouldn't be approved on to the marketplace.\n",
    "- Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off: While the loan was charged off, the loan application today would no longer meet the credit policy and wouldn't be approved on to the marketplace.\n",
    "- In Grace Period: The loan is past due but still in the grace period of 15 days.\n",
    "- Late (16-30 days): Loan hasn't been paid in 16 to 30 days (late on the current payment).\n",
    "- Late (31-120 days): Loan hasn't been paid in 31 to 120 days (late on the current payment).\n",
    "- Current: Loan is up to date on current payments.\n",
    "- Default: Loan is defaulted on and no payment has been made for more than 121 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lastly, one thing we need to keep in mind is the class imbalance between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. \n",

    "### Selecting Error Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Recall the original question we wanted to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We established that this is a binary classification problem in the first mission of this course, and we converted the loan_status column to 0s and 1s as a result. Before diving in and selecting an algorithm to apply to the data, we should select an error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An error metric will help us figure out when our model is performing well, and when it's performing poorly. To tie error metrics all the way back to the original question we wanted to answer, let's say we're using a machine learning model to predict whether or not we should fund a loan on the Lending Club platform. Our objective in this is to make money -- we want to fund enough loans that are paid off on time to offset our losses from loans that aren't paid off. An error metric will help us determine if our algorithm will make us money or lose us money.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this case, we're primarily concerned with false positives and false negatives. Both of these are different types of misclassifications. With a false positive, we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't. This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In the loan_status and prediction columns, a 0 means that the loan wouldn't be paid off on time, and a 1 means that it would.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives. A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible.

    "#### Unfortunately, even through we're not using accuracy as an error metric, the classifier is, and it isn't accounting for the imbalance in the classes. There are a few ways to get a classifier to correct for imbalanced classes. The two main ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use oversampling and undersampling to ensure that the classifier gets input that has a balanced number of each class.\n",
    "   - Tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class.\n",

    "#### We'll look into oversampling and undersampling first. They involve taking a sample that contains equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0, and where loan_status is 1. This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The downside of this technique is that since it has to preserve an equal ratio, you have to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Throw out many rows of data. If we wanted equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0 and where loan_status is 1, one way we could do that is to delete rows where loan_status is 1.\n",
    "   - Copy rows multiple times. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to copy rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "   - Generate fake data. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to generate new rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unfortunately, none of these techniques are especially easy. The second method we mentioned earlier, telling the classifier to penalize certain rows more, is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0.\n",

    "#### Unfortunately, using a random forest classifier didn't improve our false positive rate. The model is likely weighting too heavily on the 1 class, and still mostly predicting 1s. We could fix this by applying a harsher penalty for misclassifications of 0s.\n",

    "#### Ultimately, our best model had a false positive rate of 7%, and a true positive rate of 20%. For a conservative investor, this means that they make money as long as the interest rate is high enough to offset the losses from 7% of borrowers defaulting, and that the pool of 20% of borrowers is large enough to make enough interest money to offset the losses.\n",

    "#### If we had randomly picked loans to fund, borrowers would have defaulted on 14.5% of them, and our model is better than that, although we're excluding more loans than a random strategy would. Given this, there's still quite a bit of room to improve:\n",
